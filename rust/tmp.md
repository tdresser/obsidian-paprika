## Description

## Ingredients
- 180g (1 ½ cups) all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 284g (1 ¼ cups) milk
- 1 egg
- 42g (3 tablespoons) butter, melted

## Directions
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. 

Try adding egg, then mixing, to eliminate lumps.

(Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.)

Let sit for a bit.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
